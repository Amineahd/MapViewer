# MapViewer
MapViewer is a Windows (C#/.NET)application that displays information extracted from the MAP file (generated by the GNU linker LD) and from the ELF executable image. It displays the module/file wise split of resources consumed along with details of individual symbols found within each module/file. Each view can be filtered and sorted dynaimically allowing the user to quickly calculate the sizes of various modules and symbols or identify those modules that are perhaps unintentionally included in a project. All the list view magic is courtesy of [ObjectListView](http://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/cs/index.html)

The application looks like this:

It was primarily developed for use with the **FTDI [FT900](http://www.ftdichip.com/MCU.html)** Microcontroller and associated toolchain but is generic enough to be useable for other GCC based toolchains. I've tested it with **Microchip's XC16 compiler** and should also be useful for XC32 (with some minimal porting).

I've written a blog post with more details on the application [here](http://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/900.php).

# Usage Guide
1. Input the paths to the MAP and ELF image in the text boxes.
2. Click on the Settings button and configure the path to Binutils NM and READELF provided by your toolchain.
3. Update the Segment to Sections mapping if your target is not FT32 or XC16 (PIC24)
4. Close the settings and click on the "Analyze" button. 
5. [new feature] If you built the MAP file with the `-cref` linker option, you can view the module level dependencies in the **Dependencies** tab by selecting a module on the left pane. Note that this lists the modules that *depend on/use* symbols from the selected module.
6. Right clicking on any of the tabs gives you an option to export the visible data into either a CSV or HTML file.
