Add the `TEXT + DATA` section size in the *Actuals* group. The Data section consumes both flash/rom and sram.

2. How do I find the total SRAM consumed by my typical embedded application?
Add the `BSS + DATA` section size in the *Actuals* group. The Data section consumes both flash/rom and sram. Note that dynamic memory / stack information is not available.

3. Useful compiler options
